# Face Recognition App

This is a solo project I've been working on, aimed at developing a face recognition-based registration and login process. It's my first venture into this field, but certainly not my last, as I've found the topic fascinating and plan to explore further technologies in this domain.

## Overview

The app utilizes the face-api.js framework for face recognition, React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and SQLite for the database. This setup allows anyone to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the application locally for testing purposes.

## Technologies Used

- **Face Recognition Framework:** `face-api.js`
- **Frontend:** `React.js`
- **Backend:** `Express.js`
- **Database:** `SQLite`

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mate153/face-recognize-app.git
```

2. Open two terminal windows and navigate to the project directory in both, if you are not there:

```bash
cd face-recognize-app
```

3. Install dependencies:

 In one terminal window, navigate to the client folder and install dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

 In the other terminal window, navigate to the server folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

4. Start the frontend and backend servers:

 Start the backend server
```bash
npm run dev
```

 Start the frontend server
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Conclusion

With these simple steps, you should now have the Face Recognition App up and running on your local machine. Feel free to explore and test out the features.
